    "## The Concept\n",
    "As someone with a passion for music and composition, but has never had any formal teaching/is entirely self-taught, I'm very interested in how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be used in the form of a tutor that could adapt and take on different personas for a student's particular interests and/or skill-level. With that in mind, the idea for my LLM application is based on learning from the greats of classical music, regardless of whether you're a complete beginner, already have music theory knowledge, or just the average listener that wants to dive deeper into the building blocks of music composition and theory. This LLM tutor would take on the persona of historical composers, letting users learn about music theory as if Mozart, Bach, or Beethoven were personally tutoring them. So for example, instead of simply reading about a specific piece of music by one of those composers, the user could engage with a persona of the composer and \"ask them\" about their compositional choices for said specific piece of music. The user could also receive feedback on their own work, giving them a front row seat into the minds of how these composers dissect composition and approach music theory in their own unique ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The main goal for this application is to make learning music theory more accessible, by supporting users of various knowledge levels through adaptive dialogue, thus enhancing musical understanding overall.*\n",

    "## How LLMs Make This Concept Possible\n",
    "Large language models are trained on extremely large datasets with the goal of identifying patterns in text through statistical methods. LLMs don't \"think\" or \"understand\" like us humans do, they predict the next word in a string of text, much like predictive text on a mobile phone. This is achieved by processing billions of textual examples in any given dataset, allowing the model to excel at pattern matching and creating contextual responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my application, this allows for important teaching capabilities to be executed by the LLM such as imitating styles (adopting a composer's written style), adaptive responses (adjusting complexity based on the user's current skill level), contextually building upon knowledge (referencing previous questions and conversations), and personalised feedback (analysing a user's work and giving specific feedback on it).\n",

    "## The Application Design\n",
    "### Training The LLM\n",
    "This LLM would be trained on all kinds of historical data relating to specific composers, thus forming each persona. Through processing historical documents of that time period, letters and documents from the composer, modern day research into the composer and their music, and analysis on the music notation itself, this would lead to an LLM forming an understanding of how that specific composer was perhaps described by their contemporaries and those who came after, how their works are analysed, and what techniques are usually attributed to them... this would enable a persona to have specific teaching \"styles\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The persona's textual response to the user would adopt to a composer's written style (as would be learned from their personal letters or documents), which would give the impression you're \"being taught by Mozart\". In regards to asking about specific techniques used in a composer's piece of music, due to the data the LLM is trained on, you would receive different variations of answers to the same question if you are to ask each composer, as they all utilised these techniques in their own way (Bach for example often being thought of as the godfather of counterpoint, Mozart and his prominent use of Alberti bass, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, LLMs can of course hallucinate and generate incorrect information, so to be as open and transparent to the user as possible, the first prompt/message (from the composer persona, to the user) in the chat window should be a disclaimer that clarifies this application is simply an LLM trained on sources about the composer. This shows overall awareness, and clarity from an ethical standpoint, which in turn should foster trust in the application. So, perhaps something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> As an AI model, I am only able to provide musical insights as \"COMPOSER-NAME-HERE\" based on my analysis of their sheet music, historical documents, and the available research conducted on \"COMPOSER-NAME-HERE\". All further communication in this chat is based solely on my interpretation of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How The LLM Would Be Used\n",
    "1. The user would select a composer persona they wish to converse with, based on their learning goals.\n",
    "2. The user would then input a question or extract from a composition, be it the composer's composition or the user's own.\n",
    "3. The LLM would then identify the appropriate knowledge level, and what type of explanation or response is needed.\n",
    "4. The LLM would then respond in a way that \"mimics\" the selected composer persona, based off the trained data in their written style, and the documented techniques of which the composer is known to use.\n",
    "5. After receiving a response from the user, the LLM would then continue to refine its output to the user, be it providing a deeper explanation, simplifying a previous response or concept, or asking the user questions to reinforce their learning.\n",
    "6. This process would be repeated to help the user develop an understanding, through exploration and curiosity, of whatever topic they wish to learn about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Value For The User\n",
    "Getting private music theory or composition lessons always comes with a cost, which unfortunately has always been a barrier of entry for many. An LLM application like this would allow users to dip their toes in the water and get accustomed to music theory and composition before needing to invest money into lessons (if they wish to do so down the line). Having multiple personas would allow the user to see the same concepts through the eyes of multiple other people, thus being able to derive their own meaning for a concept and perhaps how they would use it in their own compositions, as opposed to learning a concept and sticking to it as if it were a \"rule\" (there are no rules in music!). Also, this would allows a user to learn completely at their own pace, and not feel embarrassed to ask simple questions they may think of as being \"silly\" if they were to ask in a classroom setting, which in turn would prevent them from learning in the first place.\n",

    "## Reflection\n",
    "This LLM application would offer genuine potential in making classical music theory much more accessible, as well as being engaging and personal for each user's specific goals in what they wish to learn and explore. It would help to reduce the intimidation of learning music theory in the first place, as it can feel overwhelming, which may turn people away from ever learning it in the first place. Having a AI tutor in the form of some of the greatest composers to ever live would not only add fun and enjoyment to the learning experience, but perhaps encourage users to think in different ways about specific parts of music theory, which in modern day textbook form may be extremely dry and boring to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the potential shortcomings of this application can't, in good conscience, be overlooked. This, as with all LLMs being used as \"tutors\", should of course only supplement learning, NOT completely replace teaching done by an actual person. So while this may help foster curiosity and excitement, it's important to remember this tool is trained on pre-existing data, and doesn't involve human creativity, which is **crucial** not only in learning a creative art form, but in further fuelling the excitement to carry on learning the craft. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an AI chatbot can only take you so far, but used with purpose it could help people discover the joys of music on a much more personal level, and make the building blocks of music theory seem more approachable."
